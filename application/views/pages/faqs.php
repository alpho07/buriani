        <p><strong>What is BURIANI all about?</strong><br>
            BURIANI is an online obituary / classifieds platform that offers buyers and sellers a unique opportunity to effectively reach their target audience.
            Sellers advertise their items on our website, you browse the items you like and then contact the seller directly to arrange an exchange.
        </p><br>
        <p><strong>How Can I Find An Obituary Or Guest Book? </strong><br>
            To locate an obituary or Guest Book, begin at our homepage, www.buriani.co.ke
            Notice the "Search Obituaries" box in the upper-right corner of the screen. Type in the deceased’s first and last name into the search boxes (only the last name is required, but entering a first name will help narrow your results). Once you’ve entered this information, click the green arrow to the right.
            This will lead you to a list of people sharing the deceased’s name. Click on the highlighted name of the person you are looking for, and the obituary will be displayed.
            If the obituary includes a Guest Book, you will see a “Guest Book” link. Clicking on it will allow you to view all current entries and add your own.
        </p><br>

        <p><strong>How Can I Sign A Guest Book? </strong><br>
            To sign a Guest Book, first locate the obituary or death notice. If the obituary includes a Guest Book, you will see a link to visit the Guest Book. Clicking this link will bring you to the page where you can view all current entries. At the upper-right of the Guest Book page, there is a section labeled "Sign the Guest Book" where you can enter your message.
            After you type your message, click "Next". You can make changes or corrections to your entry by clicking "Edit entry." When you are satisfied with the appearance of your entry, you can complete the process by clicking "Submit entry," located below the preview of your entry. You must click “Submit entry” to complete your entry. You'll know you've successfully submitted your entry when you see a thank you message on the confirmation page.
            Please note that entries do not appear online immediately. All entries are reviewed for appropriate content and typically appear online within a few hours.
        </p><br>

        <p><strong>I Have Signed A Guest Book, But I Don’t See My Entry Online. Where Is It? </strong><br>
            All Guest Book entries are screened by our staff for appropriate content before being placed online.
            Please allow 24 hours for review, and then check the Guest Book for your entry. If you don't see your entry after 24 hours, and you believe it meets our guidelines, please contact us with your name, the full name of the deceased and the date of your entry. We will be happy to investigate the status of your entry.

        <p><strong>How Can I Keep A Guest Book Online Longer? </strong><br>
            Keeping this Guest Book available online is a wonderful way to allow those who knew your loved one to express their sympathy and share fond memories. Even if you are not a member of the family, consider keeping this Guest Book open as a special gift to the family. Keep this Guest Book online by purchasing a sponsorship. By doing this, you'll be giving loved ones a place to express their feelings and share memories any time they'd like in the months and years ahead.
            To sponsor a Guest Book, please click “Keep Guest Book Online” at the top of the Guest Book page. This will take you to a page where you can view options for extending the Guest Book past the current expiration date and place an order online.
            If you do not see this link, the Guest Book has already been sponsored.
            If the Guest Book has already been sponsored for one year and you would like to extend it further, please check the Guest Book approximately five days before the current sponsorship is due to expire. At that time, there will be a link on the Guest Book page to extend the sponsorship.
        </p><br>
        <p><strong>How Can I Restore A Guest Book That Is No Longer Online? </strong><br>
            Even after a Guest Book expires, we retain all Guest Book entries that have appeared online. If you would like to restore a Guest Book that is no longer online and view all previous entries, you can do so by purchasing a paid sponsorship. If you are interested in this option, please contact us.
